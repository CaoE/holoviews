    "\n",
    "The corresponding [User Guide](../user_guide/03-Customizing_Plots.ipynb) entry explains the keywords used in detail, but a quick summary is that when you tab-complete using the `opts` utility, you are completing across two fundamental types of options called ***plot options*** and ***style options***. HoloViews will manage this distinction for you but it is worth noting that the `color` and `line_width` keywords passed to the `Curve` and `Spikes` option objects correspond to the color and line widths of the corresponding [Bokeh glyphs](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html).\n",

HoloViews offers many other tools for setting options either locally or globally, including the aforementioned IPython specific magics, are described in the [User Guide](../user_guide/03-Customizing_Plots.ipynb). This user guide includes a recommendation on how you can customize sophisticated, composite visualizations in a consistent way."
